                            <h1 >Hi there! Iâ€™m Ouassima â€” a frontend developer in progress and a creative at heart. Welcome to my learning journal.ðŸŒ±</h1>
                            <p>I've always loved visuals and storytelling, which naturally led me to frontend development. But the journey hasnâ€™t been easy. Staying committed, focused, and consistent was something I struggled with at first â€” until I found Scrimba.
                                Through their interactive lessons and hands-on projects, I started building real things and slowly gained the confidence I was missing. This blog is a space where I document what Iâ€™ve learned, what Iâ€™m working on, and how Iâ€™ve grown â€” not just as a developer, but as someone learning to trust her own path.
                                Whether you're just starting out or figuring things out like me, I hope my posts help you feel less alone in the journey. ðŸ’»âœ¨

                        <h2>How I stay committed to learning</h2>
                        <p class="full-hero-para">Staying consistent hasnâ€™t always been easy for me. I used to spend hours learning, but Iâ€™d often jump from one thing to another without a clear plan. Now, I try to apply everything I learn right away â€” by building small projects or improving existing ones. Thatâ€™s helped me stay focused and make real progress.
                        </p>
                        <p class="full-hero-para">I also realized that sharing what Iâ€™m learning helps me stay motivated. It holds me accountable, and it creates a space where I can connect with others on the same path.
                        </p>
                        <h2>How I got started</h2>
                        <p class="full-hero-para">I started small. I would take notes while learning, and then reflect on those lessons in my own words. Eventually, I turned those notes into short posts â€” and this journal was born!


                        </p>
                        <p class="full-hero-para">Writing about my learning journey has helped me truly understand the concepts Iâ€™m studying. Itâ€™s also become a way for me to support and inspire others, just like so many people in the community have inspired me.
